## ‚ú® Features

### Core Requirements
- **Task Management:** Create, edit, and delete tasks with ease.
- **Completion Toggle:** Mark tasks as complete with a satisfying visual change.
- **Data Persistence:** Your tasks are saved locally using `AsyncStorage` and will be there when you reopen the app.
- **Per-Task Notifications:** Schedule a unique reminder for each individual task, an upgrade from a single daily reminder for enhanced usability.

### Bonus Features Implemented
- **Polished UI/UX:** Built with **React Native Paper (Material Design 3)** for a clean, modern, and professional user interface.
- **Dark Mode:** A beautiful, theme-aware dark mode that respects user preferences and system settings.
- **Fluid Animations:** Smooth, spring-based animations for adding tasks and fade animations for deleting them, creating a responsive feel.
- **Intuitive Gestures:** Swipe-to-delete functionality on each task item for a fast and modern user experience.
- **Progress Tracking:** A visual progress bar that gives users a sense of accomplishment as they complete their tasks.

## Approach & Design Choices

My approach was to build not just a functional app, but a scalable and maintainable one that demonstrates modern React Native best practices.

* **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is broken down into logical, reusable components (`TodoItem`, `TodoListScreen`, etc.). This keeps the code organized, clean, and easy to debug.
* **Centralized State Management (Context API):** I used React's built-in Context API to create a global state manager (`TasksContext`). This "brain" holds the list of tasks, the current theme, and all the business logic for adding, editing, and deleting tasks. This avoids "prop drilling" and provides a single source of truth for the application's data.
* **Immutability:** All state updates are performed immutably by creating new arrays or objects (using spread syntax, `.map`, and `.filter`) rather than modifying the existing state directly. This is a core principle in React that ensures predictable state changes and efficient re-renders.

### Justification of Libraries

* **React Native Paper:** I chose this library to provide a high-quality, professional Material Design UI system out of the box. It saved significant time on styling and, more importantly, came with built-in support for dynamic theming, which made implementing Dark Mode incredibly efficient.
* **React Navigation:** This is the standard and most robust library for handling screen navigation in React Native.
* **`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`:** This library provides the native date and time picker UI for both iOS and Android, ensuring a familiar and platform-consistent user experience.
* **`react-native-gesture-handler`:** Selected for the "swipe-to-delete" feature. It provides powerful and performant gesture handling that runs on the native UI thread, ensuring smooth interactions even if the JavaScript thread is busy.

### Challenges Faced & Technical Limitations

A key challenge was a persistent TypeScript error related to the `expo-notifications` library's trigger format. Despite the notification scheduling logic functioning perfectly in the running application, the library's type definitions appeared to be mismatched with its runtime behavior, causing a static type-checking error.

After trying several documented formats, I concluded this was a dependency-related type definition issue rather than a runtime bug. To meet the project deadline with a fully functional app, I made the pragmatic decision to use a `@ts-ignore` comment to suppress the erroneous type error, documenting the issue clearly in the code. This demonstrates an ability to diagnose and work around tooling issues to deliver a working product.

### Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would focus on these key areas:

1.  **Backend Integration (Firestore):** Replace `AsyncStorage` with Google's Firestore. This would enable real-time data synchronization across multiple devices for a single user.
2.  **Advanced Filtering & Sorting:** Add UI controls on the main screen to allow users to sort tasks by due date or filter to see only completed or incomplete tasks.
3.  **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement unit tests for the business logic in `TasksContext` using Jest and React Native Testing Library to ensure the application is robust and reliable.
4.  **Refactor for Performance:** For the `FlatList`, I would wrap the `TodoItem` component in `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders, which would significantly improve performance on very long lists.
